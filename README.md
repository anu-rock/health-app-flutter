# Health App 🏃‍

A very simple health app based on [this beautiful design](https://dribbble.com/shots/7176236-Health-App) by Georgy Romanov on Dribbble. Created with the purpose of learning UI design in Flutter.

## Getting Started

1. The very first thing to do is—you guessed it—clone this repository 😃.
2. Once you've clone the repo, open the project in Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.
3. Hopefully, all Dart dependencies will automatically be fetched by your IDE. If not, do a [manual pub get](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-get).
4. Use the commit history as your step-by-step guide to implementing the above design in your own Flutter app.
