# Health App üèÉ‚Äç

A very simple health app based on [this beautiful design](https://dribbble.com/shots/7176236-Health-App) by Georgy Romanov on Dribbble. Created with the purpose of learning UI design in Flutter.

## Getting Started

1. The very first thing to do is‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîclone this repository üòÉ.
2. Once you've clone the repo, open the project in Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.
3. Hopefully, all Dart dependencies will automatically be fetched by your IDE. If not, do a [manual pub get](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-get).
4. Use the commit history as your step-by-step guide to implementing the above design in your own Flutter app. Read it in chronological order, starting from the oldest.

üì¨ If stuck, you may drop me an email at [ab@anuragbhandari.com](mailto:ab@anuragbhandari.com).

## Your Goal

This is how your app should look like after you've followed all steps:

## Bonus Challenges

Once you are done with your goal, try completing the following additional challenges to earn extra brownie points.

- Replace the font Signika with [Gilroy](https://www.tinkov.info/gilroy.html), the one used in the original design.

- Convert `HyderationScreen` into a [stateful widget](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive) to keep track of cups of water consumed. Then display NumberTile widgets based on the cups count.

- Add [custom animations](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/animations/tutorial) using `AnimationController`, `Animation` and other related classes. Let your creativity flow.

- **MEGA BONUS:** Display data from your device's underlying fitness tracking system (_HealthKit_ on iOS and _GoogleFit_ on Android). Hint: make use of a Flutter package such as [FitKit](https://pub.dev/packages/fit_kit).
